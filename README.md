# Time-Planner

* This time planner allows user(s) to organize, and save their activities, so that they can stay on track.

* To make easy the user to see their activities, they can refer to three different colors depending on the time. Grey color shows activities happened in the past, red color shows activities in the present time, and green color shows activities in the future time.
